# airbnb-clone-project

This project is a full-stack clone of the popular accommodation booking platform called Airbnb. 
The goal is to build a functional web application that allows users to browse property listings, view detailed property information, and complete bookings.
This project will encompass front-end development using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and a modern framework such as React. It will integrate Git and GitHub for version control, Figma for UI/UX design, and focus on backend APIs, database architecture, and deployment to deliver a complete, functional web application.
